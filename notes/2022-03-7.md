## Agenda

* HTJ2K/JPEG-XL Performance Update
  * DICOM WG-04 approved a work item for JPEG-XL back Nov/Dec 2021
    * Focus is on color images
      * Color images are typically encoded with a color transform
      * If you have raw pixel data, you don't know what it is or looks like on screen (exactly what color it represents)
      * JPEG2000 specifies the actual color transform being used - with a key or array, but J2K is very slow
      * JPEG-XL supports color transforms and is faster than JPEG2000
      * DICOM does allow the color transform to be encoded in DICOM (its actually required) - but its difficult for decoders to apply these and many apply something before hand messing it up
  * HTJ2K work item delayed - because JPEG-XL got a performance boost
