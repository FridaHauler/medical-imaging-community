## Agenda

*  Cloud Based Medical Imaging
  * Background:
    * David Kwon/Jason Nagels - Lead the Canada InfoWays Program
      * Looking for 2 speakers about cloud pacs?
  * PACS Replacement in the cloud - has anyone done this?
    * MedStar - Visage on GCP
    * UCSF - Visage on AWS
    * GE TruPACS on AWS 
    * ChangeHealthcare on GCP
    * Large teleradiology have run on cloud for many years
    * Many lift and shift ISVs running on cloud - but may have limited use
  * Architectures
    * Lift and shift vs cloud native
      * Most PACS/VNA vendors have had their system running in the cloud since 2018 at least
      * No industry definiton of what cloud native means
        * Leverage managed services provided by the cloud vendor
          * Object Storage
          * Databases
          * Kubernetes/Containers
          * Serverless
          * Automated Deployment
          * DICOM-Native service
          * MicroServices
    * Server side rendering vs client side rendering
    * SaaS vs BYOA vs Hybrid
  * What is the business case for moving PACS to the cloud?
  * Data migration - from on prem to cloud
    * Migration can take years on prem - is there any advantage to move to the cloud
    * Getting data out of the on prem pacs is usually the limiting factor, clouid doesn't help with that
    * Hybrid migration
      * 
  * Seems to be much greater adoption of PACS to cloud in US than Canada
    * Concerns
        * Security
          * "Shared security
        * Speed - will performance suffer?
        * Reliability (connection is down)
        * Cost
  * Performance - will it be impacted by moving to the cloud
    * Will point of care will always require an on premise system?
