## Agenda

* Processing Logs from applications (Neil Tenenholtz)
    * Background
    * Lots of applications running (e.g. AI) 
    * want to know how often they are running, what they are running on
    * When results are not being generated
  * Looking at adding a CP to SOLE (https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Standardized_Operational_Log_of_Events_(SOLE))
  * What kind of wire format would people be interested in?
    * Go more classical?  syslog? 
    * Go FHIR?
    * Should we care?
  * Mohannad's repo: https://github.com/mohannadhussain/ihe-sole-repo
  * Working group working on this fridays noon eastern (Neil to provide info0)
  * What is the ideal use case?  If we could start over what would it look like?  
    * Transport less important than format/schema/encoding - should be able to use any event bus (Azure, AWS, Google, or?)
        * e.g. https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/
        * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services
    * Not Syslog - too unix specific and a barrier to setup/get going
    * Use JSON format
  * What schema to use?
      * Prefer HL7 over DICOM for workflow mechanisms
          * HL7 FHIR AuditEvent 
  * If you were ingesting these events, what would be easiest to use?
    * JSON makes the most sense
    * Should agree on basic event docment schema
    * Should be extendable by applications?
      * Use a namespace

* Kakadujs update
  * https://github.com/chafey/kakadujs
  * Have Mac x86, Mac arm64 and Linux arm64
  * Would love contribution for windows builds

* Apple Studio and Studio Display
  * M1 Ultra - 20 cores, 64 core gpu, 128GB RAM (available to GPU)

* ThreadRipper 5000
  * Zen 3 Cores

* AMD 5800X3D
  * https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-7-5800x3d
  * Fast single core workloads
  * $450
 
* Cornerstone3D Update
  * Targeting April 1st, 2022
  * Team busy on fixing up types, documentation and examples

* Question?
  * Have a project that needs to integrate with PACS (launch)
  * Is it the same for all PACS?
  * Related standards
    * CCOW - not really used any more, microsoft windows specific (COM based)
      * Could preserve/sync context (in case user switches to another patient)
    * HL7 Smart on FHIR - new way to do it http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/
  * FHIRCast - new standard for synchronizing context: https://fhircast.org/
