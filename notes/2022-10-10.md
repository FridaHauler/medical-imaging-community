    * HighDicom https://highdicom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#creating-structured-report-sr-documents
    * Monai https://docs.monai.io/projects/monai-deploy-app-sdk/en/latest/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.operators.DICOMTextSRWriterOperator.html
    * RDSR https://dicompyler-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dicompylercore.html#dicompylercore.dicomparser.DicomParser
    * HL7 Work on mapping DICOM SR to FHIR: https://github.com/HL7/dicom-sr

* Modality Worklist Troubleshooting Orthanc with GE XR-385 (Stephen)
  * Need more detail about the errors being displayed to help...
* dcmjs-imaging add support for 32 bit pixel RTDOSE (Pantelis)
  * https://github.com/PantelisGeorgiadis/dcmjs-imaging
  * RTDOSE is probably visualized as an overlay/mask on top of the underlying image pixel data - not as a slice is usually
