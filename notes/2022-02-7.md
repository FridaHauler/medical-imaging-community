## Agenda

* Nvidia
  * Monai (open source AI Libraries)
    * Training AI models for medical imaging and beyond
    * Labeling component that plugs into OHIF
      * Active Learning
    * Deployment Framework - stream together a model into a full application
      * What is the cope for this - is it intended to be a comprehensive DICOM Ingestion processing framework?
        * NO - may be part of this though
        * https://docs.monai.io/projects/monai-deploy-app-sdk/en/latest/release_notes/index.html
        * https://docs.monai.io/projects/monai-deploy-app-sdk/en/latest/introduction/architecture.html
        * Inference service - https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-server/blob/main/components/inference-service/README.md
        * NOT intended to be single endpoint that runs lots of algorithms OR do metadata fixup (e.g. uncompress images)
            * Does not take the place of dicom routers or tag morphing
        * Focused on running jobs effectively that is configured
      * How does this relate to the DICOM Standard for AI/ML processing (WG23) 
        * Team is playing close attention to this
        * Current work item on discovery and control - in flux so uncertain where it will end up
        * Looking at IHE profiles (AIWI and AIR)
        * Looking at work being done in standards and incorporating it in a practical way
        * Lessons learned are being fed back in to the standards organizations
  * FLAIR (Open source federated learning)
    * Framework goes beyond medical imaging (could be applied to anything)
    * Allows for running jobs collectively from different sites
    * Want data to stay at the organization that owns it - moving compute to data
  * Clara Viz (not open source)
    * Framework for rendering medical images in 3D space
    * SDK
    * Clara Viz - https://github.com/NVIDIA/clara-viz
  * All components are super easy to integrate with your language (e.g. pip install for python)
  * GTC coming up next month (twice a year)
    * Virtual (free)
    * Medical Imaging specific sessions
      * Bootcamp on Monai, etc

* Visualization of volumes in time
  * Knows OHIF is doing something here (Cornerstone3D)
  * Is there anything out there?
    * Slicer 3D extension - ideal for pediatric data sets?
      * Echocardiograms can be DICOM but also some other "funky" format

*  7 Tesla MRI of the ex vivo human brain at 100 micron resolution 
  * Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHZBFm02wbM
  * DICOM? DataSet: https://www.pacsbin.com/c/W1IVmnkSAE
  * DataSet: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.119f80q

* nVidia library for JPEG2000
  * https://developer.nvidia.com/nvjpeg

* Very old cornerstone server side rendering library:
  * https://github.com/chafey/cornerstoneVisualization

* 3D visualization library
  * https://github.com/rapidsai/cucim

* Slicer3D as a "web app"
  * Uses AWS AppStream
  * Microsoft has Windows 365 / Azure VIrtual Desktop which is similar.  Has persistent option
  * YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3t5twSV6NE&t=33s
  * https://discourse.slicer.org/t/running-slicer-in-a-web-browser-via-amazon-appstreams/21431

* Lossy compression vs lossless for diagnostic interpretation
  * Simon has an outstanding "challenge" for anyone to show how lossy compression or non diagnostic monitor resulted in misdiagnosis
  * Rads are rarely aware that an image is being displayed lossy (despite indicators on screen)
  * Some vendors are doing lossy display "by default" to hit the performance targets over lower bandwidth/higher latency
  * There was a case where a bug in a PACS system resulted in a difference of about ~8 hounsfield that would have resulted in misdiagnosis had the radiologist missed it
  * is there every a problem with lossy compression that shows things that aren't there (noise/specs/?)
    * yes - happens all the time, even w/o lossy compression
