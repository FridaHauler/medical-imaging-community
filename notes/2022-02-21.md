  * 1st SOW with industry partner to build Cornerstone 3D - but they didn't like having two separate libraries (2d and 3d)
    * Finished in July/August of 2021
    * Could have released earlier, but it was a bit of a mess?
    * Requires GPU
  * 2nd SOW with industry partner to harmonize 2D with 3D capabilities (one library)
    * Must do open source release by end of Q1 2022 - march/april release (Hopefully)
    * GPU accelerate for 2D with fallback to software
    * Includes segmentation tools (funded by someone else)
  * Plans to do more in segmentation - grow/cut regions
    * Need more funding to do more - barely able to support functionality that already exists
