* Talked about DICOM anonymization tools
  * [CTP](https://mircwiki.rsna.org/index.php?title=MIRC_CTP) is of course a well known one, but not super user friendly
  * [DicomCleaner](http://www.dclunie.com/pixelmed/software/webstart/DicomCleanerUsage.html) is from Dr. David Clunie, very capable, can also do pixel redaction and has a GUI so it is user friendly.
  * [Orthanc](https://api.orthanc-server.com/#tag/System/paths/~1tools~1bulk-anonymize/post) Can do anonymization via GUI and also API at any level (patient, study, series, instance), but no pixel redaction
  * [Horos](https://horosproject.org/) Can also do it, but Mac only
  * [Sante](https://www.santesoft.com/) Have viewers and tools for batch anonymization
  * Mirth Connect is another option for scripting
  * DCMTK is another option for command-line options that can be batched
* Typical pixel redaction (e.g. off Ultrasounds) vs. preventing the reconstruction of a patient's face from something like a head CT scan.
  * Paper on deidentification of faces: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17295313/
* Could AWS Rekognition be used to find text on a DICOM image then redact it?
* Patient names showing up in the wrong places (random DICOM tags, radiology reports)
  * Was a popular practice before the advent of structured reporting
* HL7 defines what fields to anonymize, and points out jurisdictional differences. 
  *  Non-obvious use cases like health card numbers in Ontario
  *  DICOM also defines "profiles" for de-identification
  *  Difference between de-identification vs. anonymization
  *  Ethics rules that require a mapping between original identifiers and anonymized ones, in case the research study uncovers new findings that were not spotted when the original study was performed
* Talked about [SIIM](https://siim.org/default.aspx)
  * Free membership to students and those in training
  * So many different groups doing different things: migrations, podcast, machine learning, etc
