## Agenda

* RVU - what are they?
  * CPT - "Current Procedure Terminology" - codes hospitals can use to bill insurance for imaging procedures
  * RVU defined - way to assign a value ($) for each service so what a hospital charges is uniform accross the united states
    * "Relative Value Units"
    * Defined by CMS (Medicare) as the reimbursement $ for a given procedure
      * https://www.cms.gov/medicare/medicare-fee-for-service-payment/physicianfeesched
      * HCPCS File - https://www.cms.gov/apps/ama/license.asp?file=/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/physicianfeesched/downloads/pe_townhall_hcpcs_level.zip
    * Flexibility in how radiology groups define the RVUs
    * Recommended by the AMA (RUC) - lead by a radiologist Zeke Silva
    * Defined differently between private and public payors?
  * CPT to RVU Codes mapping? how is it done?
  * Canada (David)
    * does not have the concept of an RVU?
    * Have diagnostic codes
    * All fee based (every province has their own flavor of it)
      * 80/20 - 80% is the same, 20% variance
    * Do map to CPT codes, but for secondary use
    * Moving forward, highly dynamic
    * Three territories, 10 provinces.  Each jurisdiction is managed independently for healthcare
      * Codes/procedures standardized by each province
    * OHIP = Ontario Health Insurance Plan (universal healthcasre)
  * Grand Caymans published their reimbursements
    * http://www.dhrs.gov.ky/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/13100483.PDF
  * LOINC to CPT Mapping
    * https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/mapping_projects/loinc_to_cpt_map.html
  * https://www.ahra.org/

* How does billing work in the NHS and how does it compare to Canada?
  * Candaa has some similartiies?
  * NHS moving to snomed

* PACS Migrations Guidance
  * https://siim.org/news/615974/DICOM-Supplement-223-is-Incorporated-into-the-DICOM-Standard.htm
  * What are the root causes of migration problems?
    * Variety/Range of goals
        * "DataBrokers" - create longitudinal records + make it de-identified
          * Don't know much about DICOM data so run into problems (e.g. SCO tomos dont work with viewer)
        * "Clinical World" 
            * Hospital Acquisition - want to normalize patient information
              * Study/Series Descriptions (for hanging protocols)
              * Patient matching
              * Prior/Relevant Prior
        * MGH Migration from one pacs to another (example)
            * DICOM data is dirty - unique identifiers not always unique - what do you do?
              * Not always easy rules
            * Need Process/Tools/etc
    * Expectation Management
      * Start With "Migrate ALL files"
        * some are too hard to migrate?
      * End with "Migration of some files"
      * "data liquidity" ?
    * Mike Toland from University of Maryalnd had a talk at SIIM 2022 on ILM (data retention)
      * Legal department wanted to get rid of as much data as they legally could
      * Clinical people wanted to keep as much as possible
        * 99.9% of studies > 10y won't ever be looked at it, but for that .1% case, it can hugely useful
    * performance/capacity
      * Hardware speced just for clinical workloads
      * Architecture - stores updates in DB only
    * Aviram / DICOMatics
      * 
  * Does cloud fix it all?
    * Some things are easier - storage, speed, scale
    * 
  * Summary
    * Scoping is critical!
    * Data cleanup is key!
