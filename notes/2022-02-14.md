## Agenda

* How to maximize image loading speed for dev with Cornerstone and OHIF (Seth Berkowitz)
  * App was slower than expected
  * Noticed that network requests were batched to 6
    * Figured out that HTTP/1 limits browser requests to 6
    * HTTP/2 can support more concurrent requests
  * Not easy to run HTTP/2 in dev
    * Needs SSL certificate
    * Possible solution: https://github.com/jpambrun/dnsssl
    * Another possible solution: https://caddyserver.com/
  * Discovered that real issue was Orthanc not configured well - running very slow
    * still need to figure this out
  * HTTP/3 is coming and even better
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3

* Orthanc support/funding
