## Agenda
* Has anyone worked with OHIF Static WADO?  - John
  * https://github.com/RadicalImaging/static-dicomweb
  * Specifically which OS it works with?
  * Has anyone delpoyed this in a production deployment - security, etc
  * Bill Wallace from Radical Imaging is the main developer bill.wallace@radicalimaging.com
    * Can connect with him via CornerstoneJS Slack
    * bill.wallace@radicalimaging.com

* Does anyone have experience with dynamic contrast MRI- Mike (Symbiosys)
  * Dynamic contrast MRI - nitty gritty with timings of bolus injection
  * Working with de-identified data
  * What tags would be abailable with non de-identified data
  * trying to do kinetics modeling
  * Breast MR
  * Injection and then several volumes acquired at different time intervals
  * https://www.radiologysolutions.bayer.com/products/injection-systems
  * https://qiicr.org/tool/PkModeling/
  * https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/PkModeling
  * NiPY - https://nipy.org/
    * https://nipy.discourse.group/
  * https://github.com/search?q=DCE-MRI
  * Contrast IHE profile?
    * Check IHE testing results to see if anyone is testing it (how often implemented)

* Workflow optimization - Jason H
  * Epic/PowerScribe/Visage
  * 15 seconds for plain film to go to next study after signing
    * Suspects most of this is related to PowerScribe?
  * Very little visibility into where things are slow
  * As a radiologist, would like the next case ready "instantly" after signing
  * SOLE - Part of the RSNA AI in practice
    * Helps with obsevability
    * Is lacking in real world life implementations
    * Change Proposal in the works?  Focused on AI extensions
    * Looking to adopt FHIR for SOLE?
    * Owned by IHE, but a bit of friction with changing it due to IHE being more of a standards adopter
    * https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Enhanced_SOLE_for_AI
    * SOLE should make it easier to track this
  * How are they integrated?  FHIRCast?
    * Jason - no idea, need to talk to IT group
  * Relationship to "Cloud Native"
    * 
  
* DICOM Import Performance Expectations for systems
    * Ask Don Dennison - shows up in RFP
    * Peak study ingestion
     * Friday/Saturday night 8PM-3AM, lots of trauma/emergency
     * Minute - 
    * Ingestion latency
       * Super State - stroke / trauma
        * < 20 minutes for stroke (Simon) 
        * < 15 minutes turnaround (Jason)
        * Door to CT time (< 25 minutes)
     * Stat
      * < 1 hour everythign else
    * Routine 
      * Outpatient - 24-48 hours SLA
      * Inpatient - 6 hours
