 Agenda

* DMWL Troubleshooting - Orthanc with GE
* DICOMweb content type issue
  * https://github.com/dcmjs-org/dicomweb-client/issues/57
* DICOMweb and backwards compatibility with DIMSE
  * Examples
    * DICOM JSON Mapping is designed to be lossless w.r.t. DICOM P10
    * QIDO-RS was designed to be compatible with CFIND
      * Relational queries
    * Up coming DICOMweb storage commit is following DIMSE Storage Commit
      * Study Instance UID Is NOT required
    * IOCM
      * Image hiding
      * Does not support mass image deletion
  * How important is backwards compatibility to YOU if it results in a less than optimal implementation (increasing costs, reducing performance)?
    * "If not now (when we are moving to the cloud), then when?"
    * "DICOM is probably the worlds most succesful medical standard.  Has been around a long time and evolved over time.  Today it does stuff well, is backwards compatible, but looking forward it carries a lot of baggage - its clunky, slow".  5 v's to be succesful in IT
      * Volume (of data) - DICOM is good at this
      * Velocity - DICOM not good at this
      * Voractiy - (waht does the data mean)
      * Value - ?
      * Variety - 
      * Tipping point - if we move past DICOM 3.0, it will be at a point where it is no longer valuable, not allowing us to get to where we need to be.  This requires transformation and IT is good at that.
