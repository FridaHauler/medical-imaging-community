## Agenda
* Wide variance in CT data (from different scanners?)
  * How can AI be reliable if the underling data differs so much?
  * What about drift?
   * SIIM 2022 AI Monitoring Session
    * https://siim.org/page/
  * Gesund.ai - startup working in this area
    * https://www.gesund.ai/
  * Ultrasound exploding due to POCUS
  * Since CT values are hounsfield, shouldn't the images have the same HU value for the same patinet with different scanners?
  * Variance in CT Data (Stacy O'Connor).  Various things that can affect the same piece of the patient at a time
    * HU 0 = Water (some vendor made it -10?)
    * Upper/Lower bounds are not set
    * Only inner XX cm (32?) is "rated" in terms of the ACR phantom
      * If you are looking at a large patient, the outside is not rated
    * Can get different values for different organs?
      * if you need to compare numbers, must use a phantom to baseline
    * You get different attenuation for the tissue based on the energy (e.g. protocol)
    * Can feed the kernel with raw or reconstructed

  * IHE Management of Acquisition Protocols
    * https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Management_of_Acquisition_Protocols
    * https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_Suppl_MAP.pdf
  * Some vendor/startup that is adding structured data 
   * Wants to use its own ontology
   * Should use radlex
  * flywheel.io claims they have "rules" to structure MR series descriptions with high confidence
    * based on regex?
