## Agenda

* DICOMweb performance
  * multi-part mime vs single part for video
  * Is single part API new?
    * Redocument effort changed how bulk data should work
      * Original documentation - it was multi-part mime wrapped
      * New documentation added support for single part
        * Single part vs multi part controlled via content-type header
    * CORS can be bypassed if you specify the content-type without using quotes (")
      * Still an issue if you use authorization HTTP Headers
        * Passing token via URI or cookie is OK though
      * Documentation on this here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests
      * Example commit: https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstoneWADOImageLoader/commit/37b076d336951d3added50b352c4f87b78778f25
  * What is the fastest way to download entire study in DICOM P10 format from DICOMweb
    * Some people are calling the study or series multi-part mime API /studies/studyuid /studies/studyuid/series/seriesuid
    * This is not ideal for the following reasons:
        * The maximum download rate over a single connection is limited.  (e.g. 100 Gbps, you might get 2 Gbps with this method)
          * TCP is chatty and this is noticeable at high bandwidths
          * TCP Window Size Limitations/issues configuring
        * Server needs to "build" the multi-part mime response
          * should be able to stream it
          * can use a lot of memory if your not careful (need to retrieve several in parallel but not all)
        * Client needs to "parse" the multi-part mime response
          * Requires lots of things to go right to avoid massive delays and memory usage
          * Not allow HTTP Body to be accessed until entire response read
          * Client environment limitations on buffer sizes (e.g. browsers limit arrays to 4GB RAM)
          * To do this right:
            * Need stream based network API
            * Need stream based multi-part mime parser
            * Need code that can make sense of streamed instances
    * Better to use HTTP/2 and make concurrent requests
      * Requires a smart DICOMweb implementation
        * DCM4CHEE / frame endpoint is slow at extracting individual frames from a DICOM P10 instance
          * Bill has a test digital pathology image with 32,000 frames in one SOP Instance - takes 60 seconds on DCM4CHEE
            * Can probably find data like this in the IDC: https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/imaging-data-commons
          * This could be resolved by storing indexes of each frame to avoid seeking from beginning each time
    * Speed mainluy depends on how the service was implemented
        * http://chafey.blogspot.com/2015/04/making-dicomweb-fast.html

* DICOMweb WG27 Activities
  * Relative URI CP
    * Standard as written does not say you can't use relative URIs, so you have to fall back on the standard it references to understand what it means
    * This CP defines this explicitly
      * All metadata requests are relative to the study root (e.g. studies/$studyuid)
  * JPEG-XL Work Item
    * Targeting having the supplement ready in 3 months
    * JPEG-XL vs HTJ2K performance: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gS3cc7p00M3_Ub-0AC7shm16H_FCC2IyxqE2TCjpzUI/edit
    * Main value is enhanced color support (which is limited in all other codecs except JPEG2000)
    * NOTE: There are well defined ways of doing the color transform in the browser via SVG, but only supported for 8 bit data

* DICOM QIDO-RS Study Query in memory project
  * https://github.com/chafey/qido-rs-in-memory-js
  * loaded 1M studies into in memory db https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS
  * 50MB for 1M Studies (JSON size)
  * Question: how to keep it up to date with changes in data store?
    * Need to find the right in memory db technology
  * Idea: duckdb?: https://duckdb.org/  
    * https://duckdb.org/2021/12/03/duck-arrow.html

  
* DICOM Test Data Generator
  * JF Created his own
  * Simon created his own...
  * Need a "Synthia for FHIR" for DICOM
  * Pantelis DICOM WSI Generator: https://gist.github.com/PantelisGeorgiadis/fb9e305610c92633fd93fcc3e973d8a2
  * Synthia FHIR ImagingStudy Generator: https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Generic-Module-Framework%3A-States#imagingstudy

* MIMIC data sets
  * 400k chest radiographs released as DICOM.  Some tags anonymized, some scrubbed
  * Requires data use agreement 
  * https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/
  * MIMIC has other non imaging data too - EHR?
