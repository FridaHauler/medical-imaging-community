## Agenda

* Intros
  * Jon Fortes - Centaur Labs, AI Labeling for medical device/pharma that develop there own ai models
  * Vitalii Lakusta - CTO/CoFounder of Better Medicine - help radiologists do diagnostics faster and better
  * Parnesh Raniga - Medical imaging scientist with a CSRO - background is in medical imaging, informatics
  * Martin Dijkhuizen - cloud system administrator at university of calgary.  Responsible for maintaing Orthanc, works with XNAT
  * Chandrasekhar PS - Transcind building and developing medical imaging applications (visualization) for PACS.  Interest in 3D rendering, oncology radiooogy pathology

* Proposed Work Item that went to DSC (Brad Genearaux)
  * Brad Genereaux is Industry co-chair for DICOM Standards Committee
  * Full meeting during RSNA
  * Work item proposed on how DICOM returns results
    * Presented by Bill Wallace from Radical Imaging
    * right now you get a collection of results at the same level
    * adjust JSON to include tag names
    * Recommendation was to retool the proposal and split into multiple chunks and bring back to next DSC

* MONAI on AWS - Stephan Scotti
  * Interested in playing around with Monai but not sure how to start
    * Can he run this on AWS
    * Also option to buy your own hardware
  * Moani does not require nVidia GPU - will run on CPU (just takes much longer)
  * https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/annotate-dicom-images-and-build-an-ml-model-using-the-monai-framework-on-amazon-sagemaker/
  * https://github.com/Project-MONAI
  * https://monai.io/
  * https://monai.io/started.html
  * https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring22-s42397/

* FHIR and Radiology - Developed a RIS with IHE (Parnesh Raniga)
  * POC - order, schedule, MWL, 
    * Using HAPPI FHIR server
    * Integrated with OHIF V3
  * Motivition
    * Interest to see how FHIR workflows can be used for RIS workflows
    * FHIR can define tasks, plan definitions, etc
    * What does software look like when the application is built on top of FHIR
  * Created some microservices that create FHIR resources
    * scheduling
    * MWL - triggered from FHIR server
    * Executing AI Algorithm
  * Is FHIR useful for Radiology Reports?
    * Yes and No
    * A lot of working being done in this area
      * IHE Multimedia Reports
      * https://profiles.ihe.net/RAD/IMR/volume-1.html
    * You can store radiology reports as FHIR DiagnosticReport resources: https://build.fhir.org/diagnosticreport.html
 
* Structured reports
  *  Value Proposition radiologist want
    * analyze CT
    * create findings
    * Make it as easy as possible for radiologist to change AI results
    * Have customer viewer based on OHIF
    * No real standard for structured reports??
  * Q: What is our experience with strucutred reports and technology around it?
    * DICOM Structured Reporting is a standard
    * Some people are still writing ultrasound reports on paper!?
    * Does OHIF support DICOM SR?
      * https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bR6m7foTCzofoZKeIRN5YreBrkjgMcBfNA7r9wXEGR4/edit
      * https://v3-demo.ohif.org/viewer?StudyInstanceUIDs=1.3.6.1.4.1.14519.5.2.1.7311.5101.158323547117540061132729905711
  * Q: How to have seamless integration of reports with other systems?

* HTJ2K-JS - Pantelis
