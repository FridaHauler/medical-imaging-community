    * April 22 8AM-noon (eastern)
    * Co-lead for open source community for Odyssey
        * How to add contributors
    * Open science committee
    * 350 sites 
    * 160 repositories
    * Large network studies
    * Everything on github
    * Dr. Nagy leads the imaging community
    * Johns Hopkins have office for open source development
    * "Apache Way": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUt2nb0mgwg&t=1630s
    
* dicom-codecs project
    * https://github.com/dicom-codecs
    * One static library with multiple codecs
    * Has a wasm build as well (500k)
    * faster that JS versions of codecs

* JPEG Lossless Info
    * Two DICOM transfer syntaxes for JPEG Lossless (.57, .70)
    * Historical issues - GE or Philips incorrectly coded some images
    * There is no one master library...
      * libjpeg - but the design is really hard to use
      * Adobe ?? - but its not easy to use
      * IJG - someone created a patch to 6b for JPEG Lossless
      * DCMTK and GDCM have created their own IJG6b_Lossless Patch version
    * Several VNA/PACS Vendors tend to use this
    * Will probably create a repo it dicom-codecs with IJG6.b + Patch + CMakeLists.txt

* OpenJPH Updates
    * Recently added support WASM-SIMD
      * 5-10% speedup for grayscale images
      * 50% speedup for color images
    * Started refactoring the code: https://github.com/chafey/openjph

* HTJ2K Work Item for DICOM
    * Will be presented at DICOM Standards Committe meeting on April 19

* In person meeting at SIIM?
    * Yes lets find a time during the day for this

* What has changed in medical imaging open source over the past 6 years?
    * Cornerstone3D - (Alireza Sedghi) new version came out with GPU accelerated 3D rendering
    * OHIF V3 - (Alireza Sedghi)
    * MONAI (Label/Deploy) - Brad Genereaux
    * Orthanc is having funding problems
    * dcmjs - (Steve Pieper) javascript dicom library - can create/write dicom p10
    * vtkjs - (kitware) VTK running in javascript with WebGL
    * slicer3d - (Steve Pieper) cloud hosting
    * dcmjs-dimse - (Pantelis Georgiadis) javascript DIMSE library
    * highdicom - (Markus Herrmman / Chris Bridge) layer on top of pydicom to encode DICOM SEG - capture AI results
    * IHE AI Workflow - AIW-I (AI Workflow for Imaging); AIR (AI for reporting); AI Whitepaper (lays out everything else -creating repositories, training, validation, feedback)
        * https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_White_Paper_AI_Interoperability_in_Imaging.pdf
