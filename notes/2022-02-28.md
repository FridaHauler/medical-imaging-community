## Agenda

* SIIM Hackathon Plug (Mohannad)
  * May 31-June 3
  * Focused on education and collaboration above all else (vs competition)
  * Big fan of open source - use open source products and open source data sets
  * New and interesting things this year
    * Bring in non radiology images - pathology, dermatology, opthtalmology|ophthalmology?
    * Blockchain demystified
  * OK to team up/pair with others at the 
  * OK to just hang around and observe
  * Slack Channel: https://join.slack.com/t/siimhackathon/shared_invite/zt-mkk0yn2e-KUqOLi6ETBUQmOffxmcQxA
  * Particpation is 100% free - but you need an API key (free)
  * Various virtual meetings dureing the hackathon
    * Orientation (2 weeks before hand)
    * Brainstorm meeting (May 31)
    * Check in meetings 2x daily

* Segmentation (automatic, semi-automatic, manual)
  * Good open source projects (automatic and semi-automatic)
    * https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel
      * Nice tool to put your monai labels from nVidia/Kitware
      * Allows you to deploy the models in 3D Slicer and OHIF
      * Nice feature for continuous learning (make corrections and send them back to model to train it/make it better)
      * Built on top of pytorch
      * Several models and architectures available on github
        * Some examples for https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials segmentation architectures
    * Microsoft Inner Eye
      * https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-innereye-open-source-software-for-medical-imaging-ai/ 
    * OHIF
      * basic manual segmentation tools
    * 3DSlicer
      * ??
    * https://medseg.ai
      * https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-sakinis/
      * All browser side (tensorflow.js?)
    * VGG's VIA Tool (standalone html, manual)
      * https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/
    * https://www.crowds-cure.org/
  * Good commercial offerings
    * md.ai
    * Axial3D
      * Taking DICOMs - run inference against this, produces segmentation
      * Have a whole team of biomed engineers that adjust the segmentation as needed
      * Generate meshes from the segmentation - can be rendered in web app or sent to 3D printer
      * Have a set of models trained against labels generated by biomed engineers over the years
      * Use Cases:
        * Educational
        * Moving towards planning for surgerys
        * Discovering new ones
          * Hospital networks..
  * DICOM SEG
    * Any experience generating or reading these?
    * Andre Fidorav has a toolkit for this - import/export between Nifti and DICOM SEG.  Also has DICOM-SR TID1500 and parametric maps (for quantification)
      * https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi

* SIIM - June 9-11 in person also virtual option?
  * https://siim.org/page/meetings 

* Is there a platform for moderately technical people in terms of model training to do less sophisticated model training for classification (e.g. how to tell MR from CT)
  * Google AutoML, AWS SageMaker
  * Once you train the model, can you export this into tensorflow.js so you can run in browser?
    * Google was locked into their service (at least of a few years ago)
  * most effort goes into data pipeline - normalization, anonymization
  * In one of RSNA 2021 course this was used https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image
